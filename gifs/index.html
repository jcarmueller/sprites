  <h1>Sprites</h1>
    In this game you’re a dancing man who is trying to collect apples to share with your friends. You have to get the apples from the angry trees without getting eaten or killed by the evil farmer who owns the trees. Once you have the apples you have to be careful that the giant blue birds don’t steal them from you before you're able to share your loot.
